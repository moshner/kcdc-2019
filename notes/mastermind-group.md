<!-- Summary: -->
Mastermind groups are a good place to help you with your career and job. There are two different formats: 'hot seat' and 'round robin'. These groups can be really helpful but you need to have like minded goals. You can get started by reaching out to people where they gather. 

## Mastermind Group
* A group of mutual improvement
* A friendly alliance of like minded people dedicated to support each other
* Helps organize knowledge

## Who could benefit from a mastermind?
* Entrepreneurs
* Freelancers
* Product developers
* People looking to grow professionally

## Format of Mastermind Groups
* How often? As much as you like
* How many people? 4 - 10
    * The size of the group changes the format
    * It's hard to invest in people if there are more than 10

## Round Robin
* Provides everyone an opportunity to discuss what is going on in their lives
* Doesn't have to be in person
* one by one, answer a series of questions
* a little discussion
* meeting over
* no emphasis on one particular person
* time-boxed, less than an hour

### Questions:
1. What is your personal win for the (time period)?
2. What is your business win for the (time period)?
3. Did you hit your accountability goal?
4. What is going on in your business?
5. What do you need help with?
6. What is your accountability goal for next time?

### Accountability Goals
* every time we meet you will set an accountability goal.
* could be 'write next blog post in a series'
* could be 'write proposal for client'
* could be 'get one video done in a series, etc.'
* S.M.A.R.T. Goals
* If you didn't get it done, provide reasons. Those reasons may help inform your goal for next time.

### What do you need help with?
* This question has made him a lot of money over time
* could be 'i need a new client'
* could be 'i need an upvote on reddit'

## Hot Seat Format
* quick updates from the entire group
* less time per person
* Focused attention on the needs of one or two particular people
* Good for 5 or more people
* don't worry about clocks
* change people every time
* Downside is when you are in the hot seat it won't come around more often

## Rules to Being Successful
1. Be honest
2. Be open, about everything
3. Be Supportive
4. Be non-judgemental
10. Have trust (build over time)

## How do I find a Mastermind Group?
* Hard to do
* Find other people with like goals
* Go into communities and find other people

## Tips
* Get it on the schedule
* Attend them!
* One harsh group kicked people out for missing more than one meeting in a row.
* Don't pay to join
* Not knowing the people before allows them to be more straightforward and honest. It depends how those relationships are structured.
* Extremely hard to have honest conversations with coworkers
* It's okay to kick people out
* Document your meetings
    * Fill your answers out in advance

## Insights
* Would my college friends work for this?
* Would UXPA-KC be a good place to look for people for this?

## About
What do King Arthur, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Andrew Carnegie, and Napoleon all have in common? Each of them belonged to groups called Masterminds, or brain trusts. The term was originally coined back in 1937, but the concept has survived the test of time. By surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals, each coming into the conversation with their own thoughts, perspective, and motivations, the overall group can lift themselves to a higher level. You don't need to wear a crown or command an army to be in a mastermind group. Average people every day meet and discuss their careers and personal lives within constructive, judgement-free zones. 
 
 Do you find yourself going to work each day without direction? Do you feel like you are the only person in the world with the problems you're facing? A mastermind group would help you push forward. This presentation will discuss how to join or organize a mastermind group, including meeting structure and timing. What are the do's and don'ts? How can every member benefit? Come learn and take your career to the next level.
