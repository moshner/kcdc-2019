## About
One of the cornerstones in Microsoft’s digital assistant Cortana are cognitive services. Instead of the
traditional Screen / Keyboard / Mouse combination for user interaction with your application, it offers
different ways of handling user input.

Think about vision, speech and language – the new way of communicating with your devices – but also
how to analyze and structure these kinds of user input.

This session will give you an introduction on the Cognitive Services Platform – show how it can help your
end-users – and with live coding examples you will experience how easy it is to start using this incredibly
cool API.
