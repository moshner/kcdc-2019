<!-- Summary: -->
We played the #noestimates game[^1] together, learning how to build a backlog, identifying complications to the process, and understanding our velocity. Afterward he crunched the numbers to prove to us that the size of tickets didn't actually matter to our velocity.

## About
Does your team struggle with answering the question: When will this work be done? 
 
This workshop will explore better means to answer this question. We will learn about "NoEstimates" software planning and forecasting by playing the acclaimed #NoEstimates game created by Matt Philip. 

Through the game play and debrief, we will discover the many hidden factors that affect software teams' predictability. With that understanding, we will use evidence-based forecasting to provide alternative and supplemental means to answer the "When will this work be done?" question. 

The second workshop part will attendee-led. Bring your real world planning challenges, and we will apply the concepts we learned from the game play. 

Learning Outcomes:  
* Traditional estimation usually accounts for just a fraction of the factors that prevent us from delivering in a predictable way. 
* Identify the many factors that delay work beyond size, complexity, or level of effort. 
* Engage our customers and stakeholders in meaningful ways around delivery dates and expectations. 
* Identify the top techniques that improve software delivery performance.
