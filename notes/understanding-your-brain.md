<!-- Summary: -->
Walt, a lynda.com/linkedin learning employee took us into a world of visualization. He provided best practices, tips for how to better show visualizations, and more resources. I particulaly liked the heirachy of differentiators/types of graphs that help you make a better impact.

Also, lots of tools!

Data map: visualizing data on a map

### Infographic:

### data visualization
a display of data designed to enable: analysis, epxloration, discovery

it's also useful for  user interfaces
e.g. colorbox.io can give you steps for a range of colors for data display

cool way to visualize popularity of names

## Our optical system
* visual recognition 60,000 times faster than text
* use what your brain is really good at

## Five differitiators
Highlight the differences with one of the following
1. size
2. color
3. position
4. contrast
5. shapre

What are you wanting people to discover in the data? differences? trends?

don't ask users to enter phone numbers in all flat strings. Humans don't read number in greater than 4-5 in length.

## Red/Green is a poor color choice
STOP
Colorblindness abounds
blue is a better choice to use with red

## motion and animation
if you have time stamped data: use motion to see the differences. e.g. with a slider or automate it for them 

## Our brain can be decieved!
patterns in bar charts may disquise your data

## Pie charts
They are bad - edward tufty

## proportion errors
also a problem, try stacking instead of increasing height and width
