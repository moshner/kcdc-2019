<!-- Summary: -->
Walt, a lynda.com/linkedin learning employee took us into a world of visualization. He provided best practices, tips for how to better show visualizations, and more resources. I particulaly liked the heirachy of differentiators/types of graphs that help you make a better impact.

Also, lots of tools!

### dataviscatalogue.com/ - resource
* helps you define methods, functions, etc

### github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery
* visuallizations done with javascript
* great inspiration!
* go tot he visualization collection from the above link. Real data using above techinques

### Infographic: 
multi-section visual representation of information intended to communicate one or more specific messages. usually designed created

### pie charts
our brains don't see pie slices very well.

### data visualization
a display of data designed to enable: analysis, epxloration, discovery

it's also useful for  user interfaces
e.g. colorbox.io can give you steps for a range of colors for data display

cool way to visualize popularity of names

## Our optical system
* visual recognition 60,000 times faster than text
* use what your brain is really good at

## Five differitiators
Highlight the differences with one of the following
1. size
2. color
3. position
4. contrast
5. shapre

What are you wanting people to discover in the data? differences? trends?

don't ask users to enter phone numbers in all flat strings. Humans don't read number in greater than 4-5 in length.

## Red/Green is a poor color choice
STOP
Colorblindness abounds
blue is a better choice to use with red

## motion and animation
if you have time stamped data: use motion to see the differences. e.g. with a slider or automate it for them 

## Our brain can be decieved!
patterns in bar charts may disquise your data

## Pie charts
They are bad - edward tufty

## proportion errors
also a problem, try stacking instead of increasing height and width

## Data Vis Tools
* Infogr.am
* Tableau
* Flourish
* Processing
* ProcessingJS

## Data Vis Tools - JS
* D3.js : dynamic, interactive
* DC.js : charting library

## Data vis - browser tools
* SVG
* 2D canvas
* Web GL

Wow! amazing representation of ocean currents

## About
No one questions that data is vital to application development, our teams spend untold hours obsessing about data structures. We build useful data layers and strive to eliminate processing roadblocks so that our data services are fast and fluid.

Do you spend that much effort on the visual portrayal of the data? If not, why not?

At some point in the data analytics cycle you need to show results to the stakeholder. Thatâ€™s when choosing the correct visual representation of the data becomes vital. Do it wrong and the data is merely wrapped in pretty graphics; do it right and the user perceives their information in clear and meaningful patterns. 

This fast paced and entertaining session starts by looking at how your brain and optical system perceive data. This session explores the overall visualization concepts that make data easier to grasp. Do you know the best way to show data to your users, so that the information is clear and understandable? Come to this session to learn how to make your data shine.
