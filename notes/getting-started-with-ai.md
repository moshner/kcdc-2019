<!-- Summary: -->
A fantastic overview of Artificial Intelligence. He doesn't talk about how to build it or use it but rather talks about they high level context, definitions, theory, and posed ethical questions. Your job will be replace by AI someday soon, what are you going to do about it? Retire, react, or fall behind?

## Definitions
General AI
: these are futuristic AI

Narrow AI
: type of AI to solve a narrow set of problems

## Narrow AI 
* Data driven AI where computers program themselves based on data
* There is a huge gap in the AI space

## What is AI?
any software that is trying to replicate aspects of human intelligence.

first ones date to 1950s

a lot of expectations were disillusioned in the 1990s lead to the AI winter. This ended in mid 2000s

### Google voice assistant:

this is a lot of smoke and mirrors: this is a lot of programming still but the natural language part is getting there.

## Why is it important?

### Data Science Trend
Sits between data engineering and the scientific method

A lot of business are entering the data science world.

Several industries habe been transformed: financial industry, baseball, and argiculture.

**We have an internet of cows now!**

anywhere you can make data science related decision you can beat the market

"Data science is the foundation of modern data-driven AI."

### Machine Learning Trend
Sub field of AI based on statistics

finds statistical patterns in data

data -> function -> prediction

e.g. 
1. You want to see if an image detects cats
2. get a bunch of pcitures
3. get humans to label the images
4. feed into machine training algorithm
5. produces a modal/function
6. Then a new picture is added and it returns a prediction on the new data

Types:
1. Classificaiton: Predict lickly hood of paying back a loan
1. Regression: make a numeric prediction based on other variables
1. cluster anaysis
1. anomoly detection

They have found that certain coorelations like beer and diapers are bought together.

e.g.predicting pregnacy due date

e.g. hurricanes correlate with strawberry pop-tart sales in the path of the hurricane

There is a lot to be done yest

### Deep Learning Trend
Is a new type of machine learning that stacks multiple layers of machine learning on top of each other to improve the overall

DNN Generator
: Generative advisarial netowrk, flips the deep learning trend backwards.

e.g. Deep fakes

e.g. YOLO. Real-Time Object Detection

e.g. can generate real looking celebreties

e.g. http://grailcs.washington.edu/... ug

### Reinforcement Learning Trend
Most powerful technology

involves an agent acting inside an environment.

the environment has state, (conditions of the road, obstacle, etc.). agent senses the state, agent can have actions which changes the state of the environment. we also give the agent a reward signal, to teach the agent to succeed.

e.g. give vehicle a point for each save 

recently they have combined deep learning with reinforment learning!

e.g. deep mind broke through with 8 bit video game

this is coming to business world too

How it works:
1. Step 1 - train in a computer simulation
1. step 2 - train in a safe environment
1. Step 3 - Deploy and monitor

"reinforcement learning is machines teaching themselves how to solve complex problems

## How will it affect you?

* A lot of software dev jobs will be combining AI systems
    * the combination of these ai modules will lead to the future of ai applications
* this will improve the power of software development
    * e.g. program synthisis to do the regex for us
    * e.g. bug prediction
    * e.g. smart assistant 'paired programmer'
* driverless vehicles
* robots that don't need programming
* smart buildings that anticipate needs of occupants
* smart cities where resources are managed with little human intervention
* ai will be woven into the fabric of our society
* that's going to have a big impact on our economy - big social implicates
* more data you have the better you will be fore this
* AI is likely to replace all jobs in our economy
* What sectors of our economy will be hit the hardest? everything! 
* what areas in the us will hit the hardest? Las Vegas 
* Half of all jobs in USA are at risk in the next 2 decades
* a lot more jobs will appear and integration jobs
* Will AI create more jobs than it eliminates? - looking unlikely
* Which side of this new economy do you want your job to be on? With the AI or without AI
* a lot ethical question abound
* "What is our purpose in a world where machines do all the work of value?"
* Many experts expect that we wil have to merge with our technology
* The newest generation is ready for implanting things in their bodies that will make  difference.
* Technology is amoral so it's up to us how it works
* What are you going to choose?

## Where to get started
* Learn more about everything covered today: data science, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement
* Do you want to build the models or put them together?

### Pluralsight!

### Practice
* Microsoft cognitive services
* Google cloud ai services
* Amazon web services

## Final Questions
1. Are you prepared?
2. Is your organization prepared?
3. Is the world prepared?


## Actions
[ ] Create summary

[ ] Migrate notes to Evernote

[ ] Sign up for pluralsight courses on this

[ ] Try out something on MS/Google/AWS

## About
Whether you realize it or not, we are currently entering the era of artificial intelligence. AI technologies will radically transform our economy, our society, and our lives. As a result, the software industry is preparing for a major transition as well. However, most developers do not yet possess the skills necessary to remain relevant in our new data-driven economy.
 
In this session, we will learn about modern data-driven artificial intelligence. We'll learn why it’s important and how it will impact you, your career, and our future. We’ll also learn how a series of modern technologies including machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning are converging to create fully autonomous intelligent systems.
